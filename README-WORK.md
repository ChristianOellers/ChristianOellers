## Q+A

### Clients & Projects

I usually work with established clients that have at least 1–2 years in the market, 
are past the early startup phase, and operate with a dedicated team and stable funding.
My focus is on building new software rather than maintaining legacy systems. 
I am open to collaborating with in-house teams, though not through third-party contractors.

### Conditions
 
All terms are subject to individual negotiation and custom contracts. I’m open to finding a model that works well for both sides.

## References

I am open to delivering a tailored technological reference or probation work, given our conditions meet.
NDA and subcontracting disallow me to disclose some projects I'd otherwise love to show and discuss.

## Work quality

Quality and stability are central to my work.

I use a professional IDE and established methodologies, including proper version control. 
Automated formatting and code quality checks can be set up according to industry standards. 
If such processes are already in place, I will adapt to your team’s workflows.

_Commercial projects generally follow higher standards than my personal open-source work. 
To make efficient use of time, internal resources and demos may not fully reflect those standards. Thank you for your understanding._
