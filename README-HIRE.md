## Work quality

The difference between personal and commercial works:

Most projects you'll find here are my own, without community contributors or commercial purposes.
This is not intended, and all is done in unpaid spare time. I decided to sacrifice some quality standards for the benefit of faster workflows
and focusing on getting things done _(especially regarding commits, branching, PRs, linting/formatting)_. Some projects have been done many years ago,
and while I might keep updating them, it's unlikely they'll receive a full refactoring from scratch.

When assigned to a team or working in a commercial setting, the level of quality and attention spend on these standards and workflows is much higher.
For instance, I'd pay attention to proper branching, ticket systems and squash/rebase workflows. Review my public client references [README](README.md).

Thank you for your understanding :)
