## Q+A

<details>
 <summary>What clients & projects do you work with?</summary>

 Please refer to the FAQ section of [Codeconut Ltd.](https://www.codeconut.io), which answers questions about clients, projects, and team settings.

 _Broadly speaking: I prefer established clients with at least 1-2 years of market existence, post-startup growth phases, an existing team, and solid funding. I don't work with early-stage startups or on large scale refactoring projects._
</details>

<details>
 <summary>What are your conditions?</summary>
 <br>

 I am flexible to negotiate and have a ready-to-go draft of contract specs for negotiation. Contact me for the latest version, and let's discuss a model that fits both our needs, for a fruitful collaboration.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>What can you tell us about yourself?</summary>
 <br>

 See the [README](README.md) for anything regarding development. Check LinkedIn for my background and CV-ish details. Or get in touch directly and ask me anything else :)

 <b>Why IT?</b>

 I just love the potential of combining technology with creativity, and using my brain to come up with solutions to unique problems.

 My favourite work parts includes the full cycle: Build a fresh feature from scratch. Be part of the early planning and research, up to design, realization, feedback iterations, and releasing it in the wild. Besides that, I enjoy optimizing and automating interfaces, tooling and technological processes for usability or to raise cost-effectiveness of internal teams workflows.

## Mindset & Motivation

<details>
 <summary>Quality, Education, Stack</summary>
 <br>

 I value education and training and aim to play in the top ranks of my field. About 20 % of my time is dedicated to growing, improving existing skills, and keeping up with today's vast fields of technology rather than working to raise my income.

 However, I don't aim to become a unicorn in any of my fields, as I prefer having a sustainable, broader technological field at hand. For my commercial work, I fancy existing, proven, large-scale stacks over getting too deeply involved in pioneering with 'hype tech'.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Work-Life Balance</summary>
 <br>

 I've got a fair amount of experience with fast-paced, marketing-driven startups. As much as I have enjoyed the wide array of responsibilities and growth opportunities, I decided to focus on the skill and quality of my work rather than speed and 16-hour shifts, just to see years of effort vanish when being sold to the next investor.

 There is no need to rush through our lives and work overshifts due to excessive meetings or task burdens. Plan smart and plan ahead. Avoid pointless work and optimize processes. Learn to use a stack to become better and faster at it. Happiness and a stable social life ensure maximum productivity in less time. All that matters are progress and results â€“ less when or how they are achieved.

 _If you're looking for something to be finished ASAP or run a startup in its early stages, you might find yourself wanting to work with a larger team instead. However, let's get in touch when things grow or larger feature sets with more planning need to be realized!_

## Work quality

The difference between personal and commercial works.

### Commercial settings

Work done for clients. Examples of higher quality working standards.

### Private settings

Besides the client projects, most others are my own, without a community, contributors, or commercial purposes. All this is done in unpaid spare time. I decided to sacrifice browser testing, some best practices and quality standards for the benefit of faster workflows.

> I prefer to focus on getting things done _(especially regarding commits, branching, PRs, linting/formatting, OOP abstraction, testing)_.

Some projects were done many years ago, and while I might keep updating them, it's unlikely they'll receive updates or a full refactoring from scratch.

> Sometimes the best stack is almost no stack, as it keeps complexity low and solutions transferrable, independent of e.g. package manager hiccups and legacy declarations over time.

When assigned to a team or working in a commercial setting, the level of quality and attention spent on these standards and workflows is much higher. For instance, I'd pay attention to proper branching, ticket systems, and squash/rebase workflows. Review my public client references in the [README](README.md).

Thank you for your understanding. :)
