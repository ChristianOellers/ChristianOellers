## Work quality

The difference between personal and commercial works.

### Commercial settings

Work done for clients. Examples of higher quality working standards.

### Private settings

Besides the client projects; most others are my own, without a community, contributors or commercial purposes. All is done in unpaid spare time. I decided to sacrifice some best practices and quality standards for the benefit of faster workflows.

> I prefer to focus on getting things done _(especially regarding commits, branching, PRs, linting/formatting, OOP abstraction)_.

Some projects have been done many years ago, and while I might keep updating them, it's unlikely they'll receive updates or a full refactoring from scratch.

> Sometimes the best stack is almost no stack, as it keeps complexity low and solutions transferrable, independent of e.g. package manager hiccups and legacy declarations over time.

When assigned to a team or working in a commercial setting, the level of quality and attention spend on these standards and workflows is much higher. For instance, I'd pay attention to proper branching, ticket systems and squash/rebase workflows. Review my public client references [README](README.md).

Thank you for your understanding :)
